            Full Stack Web Development (FSWD) focuses on building complete web
            applications using frontend and backend technologies. Full Stack Web Development (FSWD) focuses on building complete web
            applications using frontend and backend technologies.Full Stack Web Development involves building both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) of a web application, enabling developers to create complete, functional, and integrated solutions. A full stack developer is proficient in multiple technologies, allowing them to handle everything from user interface design to server logic and database management.

    <section class="container">
        <h2>Backend Development</h2>
        <p>
            Backend development focuses on server-side logic, databases, and APIs.
            It ensures smooth data flow between frontend and database.The back-end handles the server-side logic, database management, and application functionality. It involves programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, and Node.js, as well as frameworks like Django, Express, and Ruby on Rails. Back-end development ensures data is processed, stored, and retrieved efficiently.

Databases, such as SQL, MongoDB, and MySQL, are integral to full stack development. They store and manage the data that powers web applications.

Popular technology stacks include:

MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.

MEAN Stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js.

LAMP Stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP.

Full stack development offers flexibility, as developers can switch between front-end and back-end tasks. It also enables rapid prototyping and reduces project costs by minimizing the need for specialized developers. However, mastering both ends of development can be complex and requires continuous learning to stay updated with evolving technologies.
